      <!--<h2>Hello!</h2>-->
      <h2>Who is Francesco Russo?</h2>

      <p>Who am I? Perhaps the most difficult and easiest question to answer in a few lines.
        I am a big dreamer or maybe a very optimistic person in life. I am a curious person,
        about every aspect of things, I always like to learn new things. Starting with the basics:
        I am a sportsman, in fact i competed in kayaking for 10 years of my life, now I am very busy
        with university and I am devoting most of my time to study... Kayaking has given me a lot.
        I've learnt to work hard for something that you love and i've learnt to get up when things get hard
        and you want to stop. I grew up in an health ambience and I will never stop thanking the sport
        for shaping me into who I've become. Everything has an end and every end is a new chapter in life.
        However, I don't miss a chance to run or go to the gym to keep fit.

      <p> Another thing that i must mention to sum up who i am is the fact that i'm a huge music lover,
        i love everything about music: listening, composing, studing, playing... I studied drums from
        the age of 10 to 13 and i learned to play piano self-taught (also thanks to my sister). I recently bought
        a guitar and a bass and i'm exited to learn how to play them! Last year I was able to
        buy with my own money a macbook and logic pro, a dream.

      <p> Since I was young, with my first Windows XP desktop, I have had a great curiosity for the IT world. 
        I was obsessed with knowing how a computer works. As I grew, during high school, I attended an IT 
        institute where I developed a passion for mathematics and computer science.

      <p> It led me to enroll at the University of Padua in the Computer Engineering course at the end of high school. 
        Fortunately, throughout my education, I have never had problems with indecision about which school to choose, 
        and university was no exception. While studying, between my first and second years at university, 
        I also worked in a company as a back-end programmer.
